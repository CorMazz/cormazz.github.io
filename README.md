- Video "Moment of Interest" Tagger
  - GE has terabytes of combustion videos which we cannot hope to analyze. If I figure out some algorithm that can identify moments of interest within a video (when something changes), I can apply it to GE and reduce the amount of data to something manageable.
- Steady State Detector
  - GE also has terabytes of transient time-series data. Hidden within the transient periods are steady-state periods that are useful for identifying the performance characteristics of our combustors. I could create a steady state detector that would identify steady state periods within the transient, thus multiplying the useful data from a combustion test.
