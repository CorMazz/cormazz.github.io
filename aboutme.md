# Note to the Reader

**Welcome to Cory's Journey:**

In the tapestry of my life, passion is the vibrant thread that weaves through every chapter. From taking on lead roles in high school musicals to waltzing across the floor as captain of the RPI collegiate ballroom dance team, I've embraced each opportunity with an unyielding enthusiasm for excellence.

My journey extends beyond the physical stage and limelight, as academic pursuits were another place I shined. Achieving a perfect 4.0 in an accelerated 3-year undergradate course of study and while working full-time through graduate school wasn't merely about grades; it was a testament to my voracious appetite for learning. I thrived not just in the pursuit of knowledge but in the application of it.

As a stellar engineer in the Edison Engineering Development Program at GE Vernova, I've demonstrated that past successes predict future returns. Each milestone achieved is a stepping stone toward a future where innovation, dedication, and a love for learning converge. The path I've walked is marked by a consistent commitment to excellence, setting the stage for what lies ahead.

Join me on this journey where passion fuels purpose, drive propels progress, and the quest for knowledge is an everlasting dance. Together, we'll navigate the symphony of success, harmonizing past achievements with the promise of an even brighter future.

**Sincerely,**

**_Corrado Mazzarelli_**

# Personal History

I am Corrado Ruperto Mazzarelli, a proud Italo-Puertorrique√±o-Americano, deeply passionate about aerospace and mechanical engineering. My roots trace back to Poughkeepsie, NY, where I was surrounded by a close-knit family of 6. Growing up, my father instilled in me the values of dedication and hard work, while my mother imparted lessons of compassion and love. Guided by these principles, my younger siblings taught me responsibility and how to be a role model.

I am named after both of my grandfathers: Corrado Mazzarelli and Ruperto Figueroa. I carry their legacy and use the wisdom they have provided me as the foundation upon which I will build my story.

# Academic History
Embarking on my academic journey at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), I delved into the intricacies of aerospace and mechanical systems. Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree in aerospace at Georgia Tech, aiming to deepen my understanding of the field. My venture into coding began as a solution to conquer homework challenges at RPI, but it quickly transformed into a genuine fascination. Joining GE after graduating from RPI provided me with diverse opportunities to apply this coding skill, further igniting my enthusiasm for the craft.


# Particular Interests
Beyond the realm of engineering and coding, you'll often find me on the dance floor, indulging in my love for west coast swing. In those moments, the synergy of movement and rhythm captivates me, offering a unique balance to my technical pursuits. During my spare time, I delve into the fascinating realm of data science techniques, adding an extra layer of excitement to my multifaceted journey. This exploration reflects my curiosity and eagerness to embrace new challenges, both in and beyond my primary fields of interest.
