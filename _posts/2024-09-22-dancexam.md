This article quickly highlights an [open-source](https://github.com/cormazz/dancer_test), Rust web application to enable dance communities to digitally proctor tests to advance to the next level of dance instruciton. The actual Dancexam webpage can be accessed at [dancexam.corradomazzarelli.com](https://dancexam.corradomazzarelli.com), and the demo is available at [dancexam-demo.corradomazzarelli.com](https://dancexam-demo.corradomazzarelli.com).

# Summary

{: .box-note}
Dancexam is a tool designed to assist in the grading and analysis of dance exams. The application allows instructors and examiners to evaluate dancers across various categories, providing an intuitive interface for inputting scores and generating reports. Dancexam streamlines the exam process, offering both examiners and students clear and detailed feedback. The primary use cas for this application is to allow the Greenville Westies to administer a test to determine if a dancer is ready to move from the beginner lesson to the advanced lesson. 

## Features

* **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate students based on specific dance competencies, such as technique, musicality, and expression.
* **Detailed Reports:** Automatically generates feedback and scores in easy-to-read formats for both examiners and students, and optionally email the student their results.
* **Customizable Categories:** Instructors can tailor the grading system to their specific needs, allowing for flexibility in assessment criteria.
* **Built for Flexibility:** Dance communities can define any number of their own tests, changing them on the fly as needs change.
* **Built for Scalability:** The application was containerized and designed to be spread to as many dance communities as needed.
* **Built for Performance/Reliability:** The application was built in Rust so it is inherently performant and safe by design.
* **Detailed Feedback:** Graded tests can be emailed to the testees to give them immediate feedback on where to improve.

## Interesting Aspects

* Tests can be defined with a test_definition.yaml file, which is parsed upon server initialization. Any errors in formatting are clearly explained to the users.
* The application can be hosted on any machine that can run the Docker Engine.
* A continuous delivery pipeline was set up to ease developer experience and enable easy updates.

## Motivation

This application served two purposes. One, it is legitimately useful, and is in-use by the Greenville Westies to determine what lesson a dancer can go to. Two, it allowed me to learn full-stack web development and stretch my capabilities. I had to learn how to use CLI Git, what containerization was, how to use Docker and Docker Compose, and how to code in asynchronous Rust, among other thing. I spent a lot of time learning these skills to expand my repertoire and take the next step towards becoming a true developer.

# Conclusion

Dancexam empowers dance instructors and examiners to deliver accurate, structured, and fair assessments for their students. Whether used for casual studio exams or professional assessments, the tool ensures that grading is streamlined and transparent. It also served as a great learning example, as I got plenty experience moving fast and breaking things, and then wishing I had spent more time on the planning part of the SDLC.
