# Summary

{: .box-note}
Dancexam is a tool designed to assist in the grading and analysis of dance exams. The application allows instructors and examiners to evaluate dancers across various categories, providing an intuitive interface for inputting scores and generating reports. Dancexam streamlines the exam process, offering both examiners and students clear and detailed feedback.

## Features

* **Performance Metrics:** Evaluate students based on specific dance competencies, such as technique, musicality, and expression.
* **Detailed Reports:** Automatically generates feedback and scores in easy-to-read formats for both examiners and students.
* **Customizable Categories:** Instructors can tailor the grading system to their specific needs, allowing for flexibility in assessment criteria.
* **Built for Flexibility:** Dance communities can define any number of their own tests, changing them on the fly as needs change.
* **Built for Scalability:** The application was containerized and designed to be spread to as many dance communities as needed.
* **Built for Performance/Reliability:** The application was built in Rust so it is inherently performant and safe by design.
* **Detailed Feedback:** Graded tests can be emailed to the testees to give them immediate feedback on where to improve.

## Interesting Aspects

* Tests can be defined with a test_definition.yaml file, which is parsed upon server initialization. Any errors in formatting are clearly explained to the users.
* The application can be hosted on any machine that can run the Docker Engine.
* A continuous delivery pipeline was set up to ease developer experience and enable easy updates.

# Conclusion

Dancexam empowers dance instructors and examiners to deliver accurate, structured, and fair assessments for their students. Whether used for casual studio exams or professional assessments, the tool ensures that grading is streamlined and transparent.
