This article explores writing a third-order inviscid Euler solver as the final project for Georgia Tech's AE6042 Computational Fluid Dynamics. All the material used to create this is within the GitHub repository linked above.

# Summary

{: .box-note}
A more detailed review of the project set-up and results are covered in [the report](#the-report). The following is just a brief summary showing some of the images and highlighting some of the skills developed/utilized in the project.

The final project for Georgia Tech's graduate CFD course was to write a CFD solver. When I took the class in spring of 2023, the specific task was to resolve the shock that develops on the top half of a 2D, supersonic, diamond-shaped airfoil. The mesh was provided by Professor Oefelein, and is shown in [Figure 1](#figure-1-mesh)

### Figure 1: Mesh
![Mesh](https://corradomazzarelli.com/assets/blog_posts/bp.cfd/65x49_processed_mesh.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

The actual relevant domain is outlined in black. The cells on the outside of the domain are the so-called 'halo cells' which are used to enforce boundary conditions. Note how the mesh forms a pyramid shape in the center. That is the the top half of the diamond airfoil. 

The boundary conditions applied to the mesh were equivalent to an aircraft traveling at Mach 2 from right to left at sea level. Thus, the static pressure and temperature were 1 atmosphere and 300K respectively. To make a long story short, I wrote the solver and plotted the results. Again, if you want more details, see [the report](#the-report)



## Interesting Concepts


# Python Libraries

## Numpy
[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) is a powerhouse in scientific Python analysis, and needs no introduction.

## Numba
[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/) is a 'just-in-time' compiler for Python which compiles code to make it run at speeds comparable to C or FORTRAN. Numba was necessary to increase the run time of the solver by >100x.

## Tqdm
[Tqdm](https://tqdm.github.io/) is just a progress bar library. I like to use it to let me know how long my scripts are taking.

**Note:** An environment.yml file is included in the GitHub repository to allow you to recreate a functional Anaconda environment.

# Highlighted Code Architecture

## Python


# Conclusion

Again, this project demonstrated the synergy between signal processing techniques like STFT, frequency analysis, and clustering algorithms like DBSCAN. By combining these methods, I successfully transformed and clustered periodic data, providing a comprehensive and insightful representation of the underlying patterns in the original time series.
